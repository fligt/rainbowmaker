    "*Chroma* and *graphia* are the Greek words for color and for writing, drawing or describing. In the early days of liquid chromatography a piece of paper was used to separate different dye components in mixtures. The presence of different components was evidenced by different color bands in the paper. Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with a Photo Diode Array (PDA) detector is a sensitive liquid chromatography technique that can be used to separate and identify different components in dyes and other samples. In our lab (the Rijkserfgoedlaboratorium in Amsterdam) we use this technique to study historic dyes and their precise colors are of primary interest.  In comparison to the historic technique of paper chromatography however, it is not obvious how to extract the color properties of dye components as these are hidden somewhere in the UHPLC-PDA chromatogram and absorbance spectra. \n",
