In our lab (the Rijkserfgoedlaboratorium in Amsterdam) we study historic
dyes with **liquid chromatography**. The term chromatography derives
from the greek words *chroma* (color) and *graphia* (writing, drawing or
describing). In the early days of liquid chromatography a piece of paper
and a solvent was used to separate different dye components in mixtures.
The presence of different components was evidenced by different color
bands in the paper.

Nowadays we use Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC)
coupled with a Photo Diode Array (PDA) detector to separate and identify
different components in dyes and other samples. In comparison to the
historic technique of paper chromatography however, it is not obvious
how to extract the color properties of dye components as these are
hidden somewhere in the UHPLC-PDA chromatogram and absorbance spectra.

`rainbowmaker` is an open source Python package based on color physics
that can be used to compute dilution colors for individual dye
components and mixtures from UHPLC-PDA data. This package is developed
out in the open. If you are interested you can follow our ideas under
construction in this documentation and already try out the Jupyter
[notebooks](https://github.com/fligt/rainbowmaker/tree/master/notebooks)
in this repository. Our goal is to make the package available for
installation soonâ€¦
